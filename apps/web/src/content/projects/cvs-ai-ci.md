## Overview

Piloted an AI-driven image-to-text CI automation system at CVS Health using **Hugging Face Transformers**. The pipeline automatically validates visual UI components during CI builds, catching visual regressions before they reach production.

## Key Features

- **Automated Visual Validation**: Hugging Face vision-language models analyze UI screenshots during CI
- **Production-Grade Pipeline**: Established enterprise-ready pipelines for organization-wide rollout
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Seamless integration into existing CI/CD workflows
- **Defect Prevention**: Catches visual regressions that traditional snapshot testing misses

## Impact

- **15% reduction** in downstream defects
- Shifted visual validation left in the development pipeline
- Enabled automated QA for UI-heavy components at enterprise scale

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers, vision-language models
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, custom pipeline orchestration
- **Backend**: Python
- **Testing**: Automated visual regression detection
